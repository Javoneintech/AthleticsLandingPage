    <h2>Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) Deals and College Athletes</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>In recent years, the landscape of college sports has undergone a significant transformation with the introduction of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals. This shift aims to balance the financial benefits for athletes while preserving the integrity of college sports.</p>
    
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>The NCAA's NIL policy, enacted in July 2021, was a response to a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in June 2021 that recognized college athletes' right to profit from their personal brand.</p>
    
    <h3>Financial Impact</h3>
    <p>The financial impact of NIL deals varies widely among college athletes. On average, student athletes earn between <strong>$1,000 to $10,000</strong> from NIL deals. However, some top-level athletes have earned significantly more. <strong>Estimated total NIL earnings for the year: $600 million.</strong></p>
    
    <h3>Notable Cases</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Arch Manning: Arch Manning, a highly marketable college athlete, has an estimated NIL valuation that places him among the top five most marketable college athletes.</li>
      <li>Angel Reese: LSU forward Angel Reese has leveraged her NIL deals to gain financial independence and make significant contributions to her community.</li>
      <li>LSU and California Universities: Lawmakers in California have urged state colleges to take full advantage of NIL deals, recognizing the potential for athletes to earn substantial income.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Legal and Ethical Considerations</h3>
    <p>The introduction of NIL deals has raised several legal and ethical considerations. The NCAA has implemented policies to ensure that NIL deals are conducted with a valid business purpose and that compensation is commensurate with similarly situated individuals.</p>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>NIL deals represent a significant shift in college sports, providing athletes with the opportunity to earn money while maintaining their academic commitments. As the landscape continues to evolve, it is essential to strike a balance between financial opportunities for athletes and the preservation of the integrity of college sports.</p>
